The data used in this task is Weekly (ISL-python/Weekly.csv at master · a-martyn/ISL-python · GitHub).
y = direction

x = all other variables

Tasks to do:

1. Produce some numerical and graphical summaries of data (pairplot, correlation matrix, boxplot).

2. Perform a Support Vector Machine and use the summary function to show the results. Describe which
variables are statistically significant. Divide data in proportion 80/20 (Train/Test). Also, use 5-fold and 10-
fold cross validation.

3. Compute the confusion matrix and overall fraction of correct predictions. Explain what the confusion matrix
is telling you about the types of mistakes made by logistic regression

4. Repeat the step 2-3 with Standard Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGboost.

5. Repeat the step 2-3 with Neural Network.

6. Compare the results of SVM, Standard Decision Tree, Random Forest and XGboost. Describe and comment
the comparison.
